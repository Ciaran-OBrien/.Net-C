### .Net-C-

## Reading Question

* Events
Found this easy to implement in the most basic form, button event handlers. This is an automatically created method when you double click the button form the designer.  
_My understanding:_
	An event handler method “Subscribes” to an event, by that, it means it’s tied, or will run, when said event is triggered. Be this a button, a count limit, etc, all can be subscribed to.

* Interfaces
	Again, easy to implement, similar to Java which we have covered to a basic extent. This allowed me to easy implement it and use it effectively

* Lambdas
	Completely new to me, had no idea what a "Lambda" was, until I searched for it. It was then, I realised how blindingly simple they are, it was just a matter of how to implement them correctly and effectively.
This was made easier by the IDE, Visual Studios prompts you to change your method into the lambda styling. This was incredibly helpful to code, but still didn't help to understand them, which is by far more important. This took some time out on my own to go a figure out how they work.

* LINQ
	We have covered SQL queries prior, so implementing LINQ was just a mean of understanding the formatting as part of .NET
	Implementing it was second nature, after a quick look over notes from last year.
_My understanding:_
		LINQ is a library within C# that allows for SQL queries to be deployed.  

* Serialization
	Again, concept had been covered before just needed to refresh to mind, and also see how to use the correct formatting in .NET.

* Attributes
  //TODO	 

* Exceptions
	No problem here, maybe just a lack of exceptions in my projects could be a problem. 
	Refactoring my code to polish everything will be needed.

* async and await
	We covered similar concept in C, in the form of MUTEXing and lock and hold threads in C.
	I used async and wait as part of an API call to retrieve JSON objects, and this worked perfectly.

* three helpful unit tests
	We're currently using J Unit testing in JAVA, so again this was about figuring out the formatting in .NET 

* Use Resharpers code inspection to improve the code quality.
_My understanding:_ 
		Saves tonnes of hours sifting through code and makes time saving decision on method namings.

* Comment all public methods and classes using xml documentation comments
	 Similar with unit testing, we're also covering correcting commenting practices, this tied in well.
  Follow the naming convention of resharper, use expressive names.
	 

* All in all, the biggest problem faced was reformatting what I already knew in one, or other, programming languages into .NET formatting. 
  *  Secondly, a few new concepts were introduced 
  * Thirdly, finding a relevant project to include each of the concepts was challenging. But one I had an idea or two, it was easy to expand the code to include each concept were applicable
